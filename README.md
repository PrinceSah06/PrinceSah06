# 👋 Hi, I'm Prince Sah

### Backend Engineer | Authentication Systems | Distributed Architecture

I build production-style backend systems using modern runtimes and scalable architecture principles.

---

## 🚀 About Me

- 🔐 Focused on secure authentication systems (JWT, Redis, token rotation)
- ⚡ Working with Bun & Hono for high-performance APIs
- 🗄 Experienced in MongoDB schema design and indexing
- 🐳 Comfortable with Dockerized infrastructure
- 🧠 Learning distributed system design patterns

I am currently building enterprise-style backend systems rather than simple CRUD applications.
