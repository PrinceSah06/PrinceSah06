## 🚀 About Me

I am a Full-Stack Developer who builds scalable web applications with a strong focus on clean architecture, performance, and security.

I specialize in:

- Modern React-based frontend development
- Secure backend API architecture
- Authentication systems using JWT & Redis
- Real-time and AI-powered applications

I aim to build production-ready systems rather than simple CRUD applications.
